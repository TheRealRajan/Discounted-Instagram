### A poor man's Instagram where you can like and get new images.<br><br>
It uses a collection from **Unsplash.com** called **[Portrait Mode](https://unsplash.com/collections/402398)** as its source where it gets a random image every time it loads. This collection consists of beautiful portrait images from different users on Unsplash.<br><br>
**Unsplash's API** was used to fetch the images randomly from within the collection.<br><br>
You can press on the <kbd>Next Image</kbd> button which will reload the page and get another image randomly.<br><br>
You can double click on the image to like ðŸ”¥ it and your likes will be counted! <br><br>
Its like Instagram but better becasue it has no ads or trackers and no annoying people who post like a hundred stories every single day! Enjoy!<br><br>
